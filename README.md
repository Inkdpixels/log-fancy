> Logging in both Node and the browser the fancy way using the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) module with an API that provides log levels.

## Installation
```sh
npm i -S log-fancy
```

## Usage
The package exports a single function, which takes the namespace of your module as an argument and returns the logger API.

```js
// logger.js
const logger = require('log-fancy')('myNamespace');

logger.info('This is not a monolith, but your mother is');
logger.warn('oiii mate, watch out');
logger.success('whee');
logger.debug('why is this even working?');
logger.log('hello');
logger.error('dis is broke m8');
logger.fatal('shit went wrong D:');
```

Now execute the script:
```sh
# Prints all messages and all fatal errors
DEBUG='*' node logger.js

# Prints only warnings and all fatal errors
DEBUG=*WARN* node logger.js

# Prints only messages in your namespace and all fatal errors
DEBUG=*myNamespace* node logger.js
```

## Node API
The logger API consists of 8 methods, namely `fatal`, `error`, `success`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` and `log`. All methods act like the native console API and take as many arguments as you like.

The `fatal` method is the only one with divergent behavior:
* It traces the log up to the source file which triggered it which helps to debug the exception if necessary.
* It will always be rendered and does not use the `DEBUG` environment variable / the `debug` module since it doesn't make sense to not to print fatal errors at any time.
* It exits the process with code `1` which identifies the Node process as crashed.

## Browser API
The logger API in the browser is aligned to the Node API, but only uses the native `console` object to save some bytes down the wire, so no `debug` fancy colored output here.

## Advanved features and methods
#### `.enforceLogging()`
Enforces the log output to be shown. Useful if you cannot set the `DEBUG` env variable yourself.

## Roadmap / Features to develop
- [ ] Add adapters / plugins, e.g. a plugin which forwards all messages to the `fs` or some logging service. #1
- [ ] Make the configuration possible via a `.fancylogrc` which will be resolved from the root folder of the processes package . #2
